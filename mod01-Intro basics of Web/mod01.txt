What is an IDE?

In simple words, an IDE is a handy piece of software that acts as a text editor, debugger, and compiler all in one. IDEs are designed to make coding easier for developers.

A code editor that's designed to help you write and edit your code. It also helps you make it more readabile and clean.
A compiler that transforms code written by a human into machine-readable form.
A debugger that helps you eliminate errors from your programs so that your code executes and performs the way it should. This feature provides tools to help you examine your code.
